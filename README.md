# Auto-text-generation
Auto Text Generation using Tensorflow and LSTM Model

## About
An auto text generator is a computer program or algorithm that automatically generates text based on predefined rules, patterns, or statistical models. It is designed to mimic human-like writing and can produce various types of content, including articles, stories, poetry, emails, and more.

Auto text generators use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and understand the structure, grammar, and vocabulary of a given text corpus. They can then generate new text by combining and reorganizing the learned patterns and words.

## Goal
Generate words given a set of input words on William Shakespeare's writings using natural language processing and deep learning LSTM model.

## Dataset
[William Shakespeare's writings](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.006/s08/lecturenotes/files/t8.shakespeare.txt) is the 100th Etext file presented by Project Gutenberg, and is presented in cooperation with World Library, Inc., from their Library of the Future and Shakespeare CDROMS.


## Tools and Technology
1. Python 3.9
    - Libraries & Packages: NumPy, Matplotlib, Keras, Tensorflow
2. Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
Auto text generators have a wide range of applications. They can be used to automate content creation for websites, social media posts, or marketing materials. They can also assist writers in generating ideas, overcoming writer's block, or expanding on existing texts. Additionally, auto text generators are employed in chatbots and virtual assistants to generate responses and engage in natural language conversations with users.

## Future Work
There have been several advancements and improvised models in text generation since the introduction of LSTM-based models. One notable model is the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series, developed by OpenAI. GPT models have significantly pushed the boundaries of text generation, exhibiting improved diversity, creativity, and context awareness compared to earlier approaches. However, it's important to note that challenges still remain, such as generating more concise and focused text and ensuring ethical considerations and unbiased outputs.
